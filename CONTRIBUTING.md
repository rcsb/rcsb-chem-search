# Contributing

### Bug reports, feature requests, and questions

To report a bug or request a feature, or to ask a question questions,
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rcsb/rcsb-chem-search/issues/new).

### Source code contributions

Contributions are always welcome.
Before writing any code, discuss the proposed changes with the developers by opening an Issue.

Avoid making changes not related to the proposal so that your contributions are properly listed.
Feel free to open a draft pull request (PR) at any time â€“ even long before the changes are complete.

### Recommended pull request workflow

We recommend the following steps, which use
[just](https://just.systems/),
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

<b>Using a fork:</b>

```bash
#gh repo fork https://github.com/rcsb/rcsb-chem-search --default-branch-only --clone

```

<b>Using a branch (RCSB members):</b>
